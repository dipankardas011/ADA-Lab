1. test whether a number *n* entered through the keyboard is prime or not by using different algorithms you know for atleast 10 inputs and note down the time complexity

Inp(n),algo 1(avg of 100),algo 2(avg of 100),algo 3(avg of 100)
100,0.000009,0.000001,0.000001
1000,0.000667,0.000015,0.000008
10000,0.049736,0.000303,0.000082
100000,3.864145,0.005921,0.000782

2. wap display an array of n integers (n > 1) where at every index of the array should contain the product of all elements in the arrayexcept the element at the gitven index. Solve this problem by taking single loop and without an additional arr
